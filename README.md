# unix_connect_configurator
WIP
This project aims to automate the remote terminal access setup to a given machine (server) without the need to configure or remember IP Addresses. You have to give the machine a name, then access it using that name. Example: ssh pi@my_rpi.local . My client (terminal) uses Debian or Fedora, the server is a Raspbian RPi.
